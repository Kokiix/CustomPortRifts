# Custom PortRifts

This project is a mod for Rift of the NecroDancer which adds support for customizing character portraits. Players can choose to replace the characters which appear in a specific tracks, or alternatively change the sprites for a specific character across all tracks (including quick toggles to display certain variants of some characters). The mod follows the same specification that the base game uses for custom portraits in custom levels.

> [!WARNING]
> BepInEx mods are <ins>**not officially supported**</ins> by Rift of the NecroDancer. If you encounter any issues with this mod, please open an issue on this GitHub repository, and do not submit reports to Brace Yourself Games!

## Usage

### Basic Setup
This mod works similarly to the game's official custom portrait feature. If you're not yet familiar with how to add custom portraits to workshop levels, you should first take a look at [this guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3487821958). Custom PortRifts uses the same format and folder structure as detailed in the guide, but portraits will be placed in your game directory instead of your custom track directory.

To get started, navigate to the directory with your game executable (the same location where you created your BepInEx folder). Then, create a directory called `CustomPortRifts`. Within it, create two folders named `Tracks` and `Characters`. You should have the following structure:
```
RiftOfTheNecroDancer.exe
CustomPortRifts/
  Tracks/
    ...
  Characters/
    ...
```

### Custom Voicelines

This feature is chart-specific for now (no global overrides).

Example file structure:
```
CustomPortRifts/
├─ Hero (sprites go in here)/
├─ Counterpart (sprites go in here)/
├─ VoiceLines/
│  ├─ Hero/
│  │  ├─ Good/
│  │  │  ├─ yes.wav
│  │  ├─ Bad/
│  │  ├─ Recover/
│  │  ├─ GameOver/
│  ├─ Counterpart/
│  │  ├─ Bad/
│  │  │  ├─ evil_laugh_A.ogg
│  │  │  ├─ evil_laugh_B.ogg
```

```

**What order do the voicelines play in?**
The voicelines are randomly chosen from the relevant folder.

**Good? Bad? Recover?**
Good lines play when reaching 20, 40, and 80 combo. Bad and Recovery lines play when entering and exiting low (2) health, respectively.

**Folders and Files**

All folder names are case sensitive.

As seen in the example above, empty or missing folders and mixed file types are accepted. However, empty or missing folders will result in no sound being played for that performance category.

Accepted file types: `.ogg`, `.mp3`, `.wav`

### Reskins
Custom PortRifts comes with toggles to replace all instances of certain characters with variants. For instance, you can play with the 10th Anniversary Update portraits on all levels.

To modify any of these settings, it's recommended to have [Rift of the NecroManager](https://github.com/96-LB/RiftOfTheNecroManager) installed. In this case, you can simply navigate to the in-game mod settings menu and easily set your preferences. Changes will take effect immediately. If you would rather change your settings manually, navigate to `BepInEx/config/com.lalabuff.necrodancer.customportrifts.cfg` in your game directory, modify the text file directly, and restart your game.

Currently, the mod only supports three reskins:
- **Crypt Cadence**: Replaces all instances of Cadence with her costume from Crypt of the NecroDancer. Overrides the Supporter Upgrade skin.
- **Crypt NecroDancer**: Replaces all instances of cloaked NecroDancer with his costume from Crypt of the NecroDancer.
- **Burger NecroDancer**: Replace all instances of cloaked NecroDancer with his costume from Magic Ham.

### Track Overrides
Track overrides provide a way to replace the portraits for a specific level. To create a track override, create a folder in `CustomPortRifts/Tracks` with name equal to the ID of the track you would like to change the portraits for. Within it, add a `Counterpart` folder to replace the right character, and/or a `Hero` folder to replace the left character. Inside those folders, you can use the usual format for creating a custom portrait.

A sample folder might look like the following:
```
CustomPortRifts/
  Tracks/
    DLCOG02/
      Hero/
        ...
    RRDiscoDisaster/
      CounterPart/
        ...
      Hero/
        ...
```

Here's a full list of track IDs. Your folders should use the name in the second column. (on Windows, these are case-sensitive!)

To override the portraits for a workshop map, first find its Steam ID. You can identify this from the link to the workshop page (for example, the Tetoris map at [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=**3422450367**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3422450367) has ID `3422450367`). Then, prepend `ws` to it to get the name of the folder you should create (for example, Tetoris would use the folder `CustomPortRifts/Tracks/ws3422450367` for track overrides).

### Character Overrides
If you'd rather replace the portrait for a character across all tracks they appear in, you can instead use character overrides. To do this, create a new folder in `CustomPortRifts/Characters` with name equal to the ID of the character you would like to change the sprites for. Then use the usual custom portrait conventions to create your portrait inside of this folder.
> [!WARNING]
> Do not make `Counterpart` or `Hero` directories when using character overrides—just place your portraits directly in the character folder.

A sample folder might look like the following:
```
CustomPortRifts/
  Characters/
    Cadence/
        ...
    Cherry/
        ...
```

Here's a list of all the base game character IDs you can override:
- Beastmaster
- Cadence
- Cadence_Supporter
- Coda
- Dove
- Harmonie
- Heph
- Matron
- Merlin
- NecrodancerBurger
- NecrodancerCloak
- Nocturna
- Queen
- Reaper
- Shopkeeper
- Suzu

There are a few DLC characters you can also override:
- Apricot (Meatboy)
- Banana (Madeline)
- Banana02 (Badeline)
- Cherry (Peppino)
- CadenceCrypt (10th Anniversary Cadence)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the changes in how the game handled DLC portraits after the 10th Anniversary update, it is **not possible** to use character overrides to replace any other portraits. Use track overrides instead, and take a look at the following section for further tips.

> [!TIP]
> `Cadence` and `Cadence_Supporter` are two separate characters. If you're using the Supporter upgrade, this means you can easily switch between two different heroes using the settings menu. If your hero override isn't working, make sure you overrode the version of Cadence you currently have selected!

### Combining Track and Character Overrides

If you want to use the same character in many track (or character) overrides, you can use the character override feature to avoid duplicating your image files and wasting storage space. In order to take advantage of this, make sure you have both the 'Track Override' and 'Character Override' configuration options turned on (this is the default). Then, anywhere you can add a portrait, instead create a file called `portrait.json` with the following contents:
```
{"PortraitId": "ID_GOES_HERE"}
```
In place of `ID_GOES_HERE`, you can write any character ID to load them in place of the regular portrait. This can be either a character ID from the base game, or a new character ID you create yourself. To create a new character ID, just add a folder in your character override directory with the same name. This way, you can link multiple tracks or characters to the same set of files instead of copying them around. For example, consider the following directory structure:
```
CustomPortRifts/
  Characters/
    Teto/
        ...
    Tracks/
      DLCKiwi01/
        portrait.json    <=  {"PortraitID": "Teto"}
      DLCKiwi02/
        portrait.json
      DLCKiwi03/
        portrait.json
      DLCKiwi04/
        portrait.json
      DLCKiwi05/
        portrait.json
      DLCKiwi06/
        portrait.json
```
This allows you to replace Hatsune Miku with Kasane Teto in all of the Miku DLC tracks without needing six copies of Teto's portrait on your hard drive.
